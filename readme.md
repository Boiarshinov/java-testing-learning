# Java Testing Learning

This is demo project that I wrote while reading [JUnit documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/).

You can find examples of using JUnit features in `src/test` dir.

### Allure
To generate allure report:
```shell
./gradlew allureReport
```
And then open report by path `build/reports/allure-report/allureReport/index.html` in browser.


## TODO
Try to use AssertJ Assertions Generator
